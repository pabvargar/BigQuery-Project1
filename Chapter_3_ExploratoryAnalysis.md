## CHAPTER 3 - EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS

Investigate data quality of the dataset as it has not been cleaned yet.

Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis, including:
- Verify the completeness, uniqueness, consistency, validity, and accuracy of datasets.
- Data validity: asses missing data, ensure that data are not duplicated, and check that data is within reasonable ranges. 
- Referential integrity: relation between tables
- Identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables.
